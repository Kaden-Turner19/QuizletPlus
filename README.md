Welcome to my little side project. I am currently developing an application that will defy all odds and become the number one study tool used world wide... Just kidding, I really just didn't want to pay for quizlet plus so naturally being a computer science student wanted to make my own and save some money. I mean come on who really wants to spend money? Just a heads up i'm not proficient in Java yet but this project is currently helping me learn how to code in Java.
